        <h2>Steps to make the perfect lasgna:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Noodles:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Boil a large pot of salted water and cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions. Once done, rinse them under cold water to stop cooking and prevent sticking. Lay them flat on a clean surface to avoid sticking together.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Prepare the Sauce:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add chopped onions and garlic, cooking until translucent.</li>
                <li>Add ground meat, breaking it up with a spoon as it browns. Drain excess fat.</li>
                <li>Stir in your tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes. Season with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. Let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Prepare the Cheese Mixture:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In a bowl, mix ricotta cheese with some grated Parmesan, salt, pepper, and a bit of Italian seasoning. This will be your cheese layer.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Assemble the Lasagna:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                <li>In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom.</li>
                <li>Place a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce.</li>
                <li>Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture on top of the noodles.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese over the ricotta.</li>
                <li>Repeat the layers: meat sauce, noodles, ricotta mixture, and mozzarella cheese. You can usually do about three layers, ending with the sauce and a generous topping of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Bake the Lasagna:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Cover the dish with foil and bake for about 25-30 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Let it Rest:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Once out of the oven, allow the lasagna to rest for 10-15 minutes before cutting. This helps it set and makes it easier to slice without falling apart.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Serve and Enjoy!</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Cut into squares and serve your delicious homemade lasagna.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <p>Feel free to adjust the recipe to your preferences by adding more veggies, using different cheeses, or experimenting with herbs and spices!</p>
